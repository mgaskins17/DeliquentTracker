# DeliquentTracker
Employee Tracker 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
I wanted to build a program that gives the functionality of viewing and modifying employee information. 
- Why did you build this project?
To develop a better sense of using databases and interacting with them. 
- What problem does it solve?
Storing employee information and viewing the different aspects of a business.
- What did you learn?
How to initalize databases with tables, how to modify them using command line prompts and also using different npm packages that create a user interactive program. The next step is adding a front end factor where you can control from a client side by creating our own api.

## Installation

Please ensure you login to mysql terminal then copy and paste the contents from the schema.sql and seeds.sql so you have a working database with populated tables. Then open a powershell terminal and run the command "npm i" to install the dependcies needed to make this program function. Afterwards, you can run the program using "npm start" or "node index.js" then follow the prompts. 

## Usage

Usage will be demostrated via a screen recording of myself working through the program. I will go into detail of the code and the different aspects of why the code works the way it does. 

## Credits

Main credits go to UofU bootcamp with their lessons provided which give detailed examples.
